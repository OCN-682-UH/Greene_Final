# Greene_Final  

Aloha, here is my final project for OCN-682!  
I made an html document to share a bit of information on some of the trait data I collected throughout my first chapter of graduate research. My research is oriented around trait-based restoration with Hawaiʻi's native work-horse taxa, ʻAʻaliʻi

Much mahalos for dropping in to see my progress as I further explore data visualization! ^-^
