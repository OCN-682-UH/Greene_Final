Background
:::

::: {style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px; margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 50px"}
Here in Hawaiʻi, island biodiversity is high due to high rates of endemicity. Diversity occurs both at and within the species scale. We’ll be focusing on the within species scale across populations throughout this project. Climate is highly variable in Hawaiʻi and climate heterogeneity occurs across short distances, leading to steep environmental gradients that are predicted to drive high intraspecific variability within plants, particularly those that are widespread like ʻaʻaliʻi.

Restoration
:::

::: {style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px; margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 50px"}
Restoration of plants under climate change may benefit from population-specific information about climate stress tolerance by helping us identify populations at most risk of decline, as well as populations with high tolerance that can be used in out-plantings.

To maximize the conservation of intraspecific diversity, we don’t want to lose the vulnerable populations and should prioritize commonly used species in restoration to inform future actions.

ʻAʻaliʻi is indigenous to Hawaiʻi but can be found in many places across the world. Varieties of ʻaʻaliʻi served as our focal species based on its common use in restorative native outplantings, evidence of intraspecific variation seen through phenotypic variability across widespread populations, its cultural significance, and its prediction (supported by kilo and ʻike hawaiʻi) to be widely drought tolerant even though there haven’t been many experimental tests done on populations that span precipitation and aridity gradients.

Model System
:::

::: {style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px; margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 50px"}
Oʻahu, served as our primary model system (with an additional population sourced from Saddle Road on Hawaiʻi Island). We had 9 populations sourced from a variety of sites that captured a 450-1325 mm mean annual rainfall precipitation gradient.

Experimental Approach
:::

::: {style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px; margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 50px"}
Our research focused on plants at the seedling stage because seedlings are particularly vulnerable to climate change, yet key in population stability. We used experimental approaches to test ʻaʻaliʻi seedling drought tolerance to better understand if populations vary in seedling drought tolerance, if functional traits and their plasticity correlate with performance under stress, revealing mechanisms of intraspecific variation in tolerance, if intraspecific variation in tolerance can enhance restoration in Hawaiʻi.

Trait-Based Restoration
:::

::: {style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px; margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 50px"}
For insights into the mechanisms that may underlie population variation in seedling drought tolerance, we measured a suite of anatomical, morphological, and physiological traits. We measured chlorophyll content to better understand the main effect of drought on seedling performance.

Intraspecific Variation in Seedling Responses
:::

::: {style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px; margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 50px"}
Chlorophyll data was collected from both treatment and control groups. We predict that seedlings sourced from populations characterized by more arid conditions will have overall increased tolerance to drought seen through increased average rates of chlorophyll content.

Trait Plasticity in Seedling Responses

::: {style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px; margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 50px"}
We monitored chlorophyll content on a weekly basis, allowing us to track changes in seedling responses to drought stress via chlorophyll content. Changes in seedling responses throughout the experimental treatment and recovery phases allows us to detect trait plasticity.

Because few studies have examined within-species variation in climate stress tolerance, our understanding of how climate change will affect intraspecific diversity is limited. Our goal is to provide some of that information, with a particular focus on, ʻaʻaliʻi, which is a major component of native plant communities in Hawaiʻi and is commonly used in restoration today, to better support our native forests in the face of climate change.
